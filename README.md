# react-starter-kit

A react starter kit for quick project structure setup. I keep following the same structure throughout my projects. So, I decided that I would make this a repository for everyone to use.

It makes use of Boostrap and Jquery just for some assists in bootstrap js. It is enough to get you started with a basic app though.

## Installation

Follow these simple steps to get started with a simple React App
- git clone `https://github.com/rahulravindran0108/react-starter-kit`
- npm install
- gulp

You will see your website up on `localhost:8000`

## Contribution

Feel free to file issues and contribute to the project. I am open to suggestions to make this better. Note: it might not be the best way to approach but I found it easier to get started with simple projects using this structure.
